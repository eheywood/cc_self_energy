# CC Greens Function Excitation Energies

Repository includes scripts to calculate the CC-BSE Hamiltonian and hence excitation energies.

## `cc_BSE.py`
Main python script to calculate the CC-BSE Hamiltonian. 

## `t2_calc.py`
Uses RPA followed by GW-BSE to calculate t2 amplitudes. 

## `BSE_Helper.py`
Contains helper functions to retrieve the two electron repulsion integrals and get eigenvectors and eigenvalues of super-matricies.
